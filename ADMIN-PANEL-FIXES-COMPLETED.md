## 📋 Status Values Summary

Your system now uses:

| When | Status Value |
|------|-------------|
| Mobile app creates farmhouse | `"pending"` |
| Admin panel shows in approvals | `"pending"` |
| Admin approves | `"approved"` ✅ |
| Admin rejects | `"rejected"` |

**Never uses:** `"pending_approval"`, `"active"` ❌

---

## 🔧 What Still Needs To Be Done

### **1. Mobile App Fix (CRITICAL)**

**Location:** Your mobile app farmhouse registration file
(Likely: `screens/AddFarmhouse.js` or similar)

**Change this:**
```javascript
status: 'approved'  // ❌ WRONG
```

**To this:**
```javascript
status: 'pending'  // ✅ CORRECT
```

### **2. Firebase Security Rules**

Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules

Replace with the rules from the chat (the ones with fixed `isAdmin()` function)

### **3. Verify Admin User**

Firebase Console → Firestore → users collection → Your admin user

Ensure it has:
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

### **4. Update Existing Farmhouses**

In Firebase Console, change all existing farmhouses:
- `status: "approved"` → `status: "pending"`
- `status: "rejected"` → `status: "pending"` (if you want to re-review them)
